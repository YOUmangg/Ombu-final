# Ombu - Easy Managing
Ombu - Easy Managing is a web application created for smooth managing of student bodies and co-ordination of various events happening in the campus. 
The web application has been created using the MERN Stack, along with Mongoose and Zustand.

# Managing
- **Task creation** : Tasks can be created by the _admins_ of a particular organization for their members. These tasks can be allotted to the registered members of the organization. 

- **Progress Sheet** : The allotted tasks will be brought into one place in a tabular format, which will be visible to everyone in the organization. This can serve as motivation to other members to work, as well as for the admins to remember and keep track of how each individual is performing.
  
- **Hot-Topics** : Consider this to be a pin-feature for important messages / topics which are of primary interest for the organization at the moment. This block can be edited by the admins as and when required. 
  
- **Add Events** : Whenever an organization wants to host an event, any admin can add that event, which shall be shown on the homepage as a notification for every student of the college. All the details such as the time, date, venue and registration links can be input and will be accessible to every student. 
  
- **Add Members** : Members who have registered to the website can be added to any organization by the head of that organization.
  
- **Induction Notices** : If any organization wants to induct more members into their organization, they can put up a notice for the inductions which will be shown on the homepage of the application ensuring better visibility and reach.
  
- **Members List** : Details of all the members of the organization - their team, email id, id number, contact number shall be available to every member of the organization.

# Know about the Organizations!

As Freshers, we are often baffled by the astounding amount of organizations present on the campus. A description of every organization, images of their events, contact details of their heads, is available for everyone ensuring accessibility and clarity. Information such as what is required for people to get into a particular organization also is displayed at the individual page of each organization.
